A musical hack made with a MSP430 microcontroller and an empty computer mouse

My brother likes hacks and pranks, so I decided to build a computer mouse that would start playing a melody once exposed to sunlight.

The idea was to send it to him in a padded envelope, and as soon as he pulled out the computer mouse, bizarrely enough it would start playing a melody.

Totally pointless, yes. But I had fun building this.

Components needed:
* Photoresistor and a 1k resistor
* 2x 1.5V AA batteries
* Super cheap MSP430 microcontroller (MSP430F2012 to be exact, see http://www.ti.com/product/MSP430F2012)
* Buzzer for audio

I put this together in a rush, so it certainly didn't look too good.

I sent it, and although it technically worked, someone in Norwegian customs opened it up, probably thinking it was some kind of explosive device. I would not really blame them :-)
